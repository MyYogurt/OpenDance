    <h1>Conjecture</h1>
    <h2>Just Dance is a proprietary, paid piece of software that requires a video game console to play. Our solution,
      OpenDance, is free of charge, open source, and can run on most computers. Users simply record themselves and
      compare themselves to a dancing music video they have downloaded.

    <h1>Definition</h1>

    <h2>Our program uses the technology of <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose"> OpenPose</a> which tracks a person's keypoints (hands, elbows, knees, etc.) through a video.
      OpenDance tracks the movements of the user in the video they provide and the dancer in the music video they provide. An accuracy score is computed based of the difference of angles of their limbs.<br>
      Our group roles:<br>
      Document Writer: Jessica<br>
      Developers/UI Design: Li, Panos, and Will<br><br>
      Development methedology:<br>
      We primarily used agile development. We cooperitvely worked on issues and flexibly worked on solutions. For example, when trouble with our computation time arose, Li was able to work on a prototype using a different technology to explore as a potiential alternative.

    <h1>Quality</h1>
    <h2>
      This program provides a convenience and a free activity for users to enjoy. It is open source which allows users to inspect the code of the software they're running to verify its integrity.

    <h1>Policy</h1>

    <h2>We have many things we'd like to improve on.<br><br>
    <li>Usability: Users need to record themselves dancing and run the program with a dancing video they already have downloaded. This results in cumbersome operation.</li>
    <li>Design: The GUI is rudimentary due to our little knowledge of Python's tkinter library. </li>
    <li>Portability: The application has a large file size, has a complex installation process.</li>
    <li>Performance: The program isn't fast enough to perform real time computation. Even without realtime computation, it is extremely slow and requires a powerful computer to run.</li>
    <br>To implement these impovements:<br><br>
    <li>Implement a feature to allow downloading Youtube videos. This could be done with technology such as <a href="https://youtube-dl.org">youtube-dl</a>. Implement a feature to record through the webcam.</li>
    <li>Study and learn how to better use the tkinter library. Potentially use bundles or packages such as Docker to ensure easy downloads that contain all dependencies.</li>
    <li>We have a prototype that runs in a web browser using javascript and tensorflow. However at this time it is not usable.</li>
    <li>Optimize the program. Compile OpenPose and it's Python API to use OpenCV or CUDA to allowed for GPU processing. Potentially use a model that is not as accurate but easier to compute.</li>
